# Collaboration Workflow
Clone the repo using Http protocol. "git clone <http address of repo>" you can find the address on green menu on the top right of the repo. 
  
You may be prompted to authenticate yourself. In which case, use yout github username and the personal access token as the password. Using your regular github password wont work
 
**After cloning**
 
Pull latest code (git pull or git pull origin)

Create a branch and name it appropriately. For example, if your task consists mainly of creating a front-end button for adding a course, name your branch "<your name>-course-add-button-frontend". As long as the scope of the work is reflected in the branch name, its fine.

The command to create a branch is "git branch <branch name>" or if you want to create a branch and checkout to it, use "git checkout -b <branch name>". If you want to checkout an exisiting branch, use "git checkout <branch name that exisits>" 


Make your changes, and commit often. This will allow use to rollback changes safely if at some point something doesn't work in the project.

After making your changes, stage the files in the folder using "git add ." This will make the changed files "ready" to be committed to the git record.

After staging, commit your files using "git commit -m <commit message>". Please choose meaningful and concise commit messages. If there is a lot to say about your change, write a description in the pull request"

After committing your changes, push the your branch to github using "git push origin <branch you want to push..usually the one you are in>".

After pushing, navigate to the github repo and create your pull request (PR) and add PR reviewers. Choose at least 2 members from the team. 

**Please don't merge your PR's before review process is complete** this will avoid having to rollback versions (which is time consuming).

After reviewe process is complete, merge your PR.
